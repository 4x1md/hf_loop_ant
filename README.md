# HF Resonant Loop Antenna

## Overview

The antenna was built to be used for shortwave listening with a Tecsun PL-660 radio receiver. Later it was used with Yaesu VX-6 handheld transceiver and with Yaesu FT-817ND for shortwave listening. The antenna is mobile and sometimes I take it to SWL on the open air.

## Construction

The antenna is built of two copper tubes. The tube used in the large loop, which forms a resonant LC circuit, is 10 mm in diameter and about 125 cm long. The small tube, which is used for coupling to the radio, is made from a 8 mm in diameter and about 28 cm long. The loops are not connected between them.

The variable capacitor is an old AM/FM radio receiver. It has five sections: 3 of 30 pF which were used for FM band and two of about 430 pF previously used for AM reception. One 30pF section is constantly  connected to the big loop. The other four can be connected using three tumbler switches (two 30pF sections are connected together).

## Performance

The antenna shows a very small bandwidth and has to be adjusted when receiver frequency changes by about 20-30 KHz. The sensitivity is not always high and sometimes it is outperformed by a long (~10M) piece of wire.

I've never used it for transmitting because my current license doesn't permit transmitting on HF bands.

The first version was mounted on a plastic tube without any base to put it on.

The final version is mounted on a dust pan:

The pan is used as a base and some stones put on it make it stable.
