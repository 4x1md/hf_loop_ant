# HF Resonant Loop Antenna

## Overview

The antenna was built to be used for shortwave listening with a Tecsun PL-660 radio receiver. Later it was used with Yaesu VX-6 handheld transceiver and with Yaesu FT-817ND for shortwave listening. The antenna is mobile and sometimes I take it to SWL on the open air.

## Construction

The antenna is built of two copper tubes. The tube used in the large loop, which forms a resonant LC circuit, is 10 mm in diameter and about 125 cm long. The small tube, which is used for coupling to the radio, is made from a 8 mm in diameter and about 28 cm long.
